            In my free time my favorite hobby is just to be reasearching about random stuff. I usually like to research about astrology and cosmology. I usually do this everyday about 30 mins before I got to online school because of COVID19. I am 11 years old and I am in the top of my class. I feel like for me researching is calming and keeps my brain sharp in the morning. It also makes you smarter everyday. I think its a very good habbit to get. I got this habbit mostly cause I always have a question and I just go to google and reasearch away.

            <h2>
                Stuff I learned
            </h2>
            <p>
                I like to learn a lot of stuff everyday. That is why I like to do a lot of research on all diferent stuff. Here are some stuff that I learned from doing research.
            </p>
            <h1>
                Space
            </h1>
            <p>
                For space I do the most research that I can. Some things I learned from researching about Space are different asteriods charging earth at an alarming rate and people finally gong to Mars.
            </p>
            <h1>
                Random
            </h1>
            <p>
                Sometimes I also like to just search about random stuff on my mind for example what coledges are the best and what stuff are on ceartain stuff or just try to learn something new.

            <h2>The Question </h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                One day I had so many questions and I just didn't want to ask becuase for 1 I thought they wouldn't be able to answer 2 becuase my mom and dad were busy. So I just thought that I should just research everything that well I had a question on. So I did that and everyday from what I researched the day before I had more questions leading me to make researching my hobby and 1 of my favorite things to do.

            <br>
            <br>
            <p> Since I don't have an inspiration for my researching I am just going to put my favorite author of the Percy Jackson, Heroes of Olympus, and Trials of Appolo series.
